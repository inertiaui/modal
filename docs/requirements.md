# Requirements

Inertia Modal has the following requirements:

- Tailwind CSS 3.4+
- React 18+ or Vue 3.4+

The package is designed and tested to work with Laravel and Inertia.js v1/v2. It may work with other backend frameworks and Inertia.js versions, but there is no guarantee or support for such configurations.

The Base Route / URL feature is supported in both Laravel 10 and 11.
