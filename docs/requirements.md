# Requirements

Inertia Modal requires the following minimum requirements:

* Tailwind CSS 3.4+
* React 18+ or Vue 3.4+

The package is designed and tested to work with Laravel and Inertia.js (^1.2). It may work with other backend frameworks and Inertia.js versions, but there is no guarantee or support for such configurations.

The Base Route/URL feature is supported in both Laravel 10 and 11.
